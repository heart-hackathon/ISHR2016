<a id="why-hackathon" class="anchor" href="#why-hackathon" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Hackathon?</h2>

<p>Hackathons (or “code fests”) are a fun away to bring together diverse audiences to synergize ideas for problem solving. Recent Biomedical Hackathons have led to a number of data science tools that became widely utilized and subsequently gained independent funding.</p>

<h2>
<a id="programmatic-theme" class="anchor" href="#programmatic-theme" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programmatic Theme</h2>

<p>We are hosting a biomedical Hackathon that explicitly encourages the participation of biologists and clinicians, not just programmers. Although programmers are adept in prototyping software solutions for well-defined computational tasks, we believe there is tremendous value in having biomedical investigators advise on motivating use cases and provide valuable scientific contexts for spontaneous projects. </p>

<h2>
<a id="scientific-theme" class="anchor" href="#scientific-theme" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scientific Theme</h2>

<p>The overarching theme of the 1st Heart Hackathon (Heart-bits) is <strong>disease signature discovery from phenotyping</strong> data as well as its applications in hypothesis generation and data-driven biology. </p>

<h2>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h2>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> At the ISHR World Congress (April 18-21, 2016) (#Exact date, time and program are to be announced)</p>

<p><strong>Venue:</strong> Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> We are looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clinicians, Basic Research Scientists (Faculty, Postdoc, Trainee, Student, etc.)</li>
<li>Omics Scientists, Biologists, Cardiologists</li>
<li>Hackers and Mentors</li>
</ul>

<a id="preliminary-program" class="anchor" href="#preliminary-program" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Preliminary Program:</strong>
</h2>

<p>To reach broad audience, we have designed the event to comprise both a “General Audience Track” and a “Hacking Track”. The General Track will include a two-hour "Big Data Introduction" session and a "Project Presentation" session. The Hacker Track will include a "Machine Learning for CVD" and a "Collaborative Analysis" session. </p>

<p><strong>1. Big Data Introduction</strong> - (general track) learn about emerging data science themes in biomedical research including big data ecosystems, data commons, data science solutions, and hackathons/code fests.</p>

<p><strong>2. Machine Learning Practicum</strong> - (hacking track) get hands on experience with machine learning package algorithms, following a tutorial for beginners to analyze a provided dataset.</p>

<p><strong>3. Collaborative Data Analysis/Ideathons</strong> - (hacking track) form free-style hacking groups or use existing software tools to engage in collaborative data analysis and visualization. Hacking teams are free to explore creative ideas for tool creation and collaborative analysis of signatures, pathways, or networks within the theme of the event.  Alternatively, brainstorm with participants in an "Ideathon" to propose data science approaches to understanding cardiovascular diseases and present the resulting ideas to the audience.</p>

<p><strong>4. Mobile Cardiac Health Hackathon</strong> - (hacking track) get hands-on experience acquiring and analysing mobile health data from research subjects, using either the Fitbit or Apple Watch APIs.</p>

<p>Possible projects for the hacking track include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network analysis, data modeling, and visualization using new or existing tools</li>
<li>Tools and APIs for functional annotations of omics expression datasets</li>
<li>Pathway analysis and hypothesis generation from the provided datasets</li>
<li>Projects to promote public access and consumption of scientific data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Project Summary and Presentation</strong> - (general track) hacking teams will take turns to present their ideas and findings during the Project Presentation session. Audiences will be asked to vote for their favorite ideas/teams. Certificates will be given to the top 3 teams. </p>
